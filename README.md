The basic Pareto/NBD model simulates two events. It uses a “coin” to determine whether a customer churns and then it uses “dice” to determine how many items a customer will order. The coin is modeled using a Pareto distribution and the dice are modeled using a negative binomial distribution. The more information you have on a customer, the better the models can fit them to a specific distribution and the more accurate the predictions end up being.
